    "story": "Today I woke up in my room in Ytterboe. After that I packed up my bag and walked to Tomson for stats class. That was from 10:45am-11:40am. After that, I went to lunch. When I went in the caf, the fire alarm went off. I left and walked outside of Buntrock. I talked with friends for a few minutes while waiting for everyone to be allowed inside again. When we went back inside, I went back to the caf and had lunch with a friend. Then, I went back to my room to study for a few hours. After that, I met with my 4th-grade Project Friendship buddy outside of Buntrock, and we walked outside of the natural lands and talked about life. Then, I went to dinner in Buntrock, went to the stats presentations for the CIR, and came back to the pod at night and now I'm typing this.",
